# Week 1 challange
<h2>User story</h2>

As part of this exercise I want to make this code base follow accessibility standards so that this code is optimized for search engines

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

<h2>What has been done</h2>

Div tags have been updated to section and aside where appropriate.

Pointless classes have been removed.

Attributes of the classes has been consolidated.

Attributes have been reorded to better match the html file.

Alt attributes have been assigned to all images on the webpage.

Title has been changed to better represent the websites content.
